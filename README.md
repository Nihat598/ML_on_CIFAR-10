# ML_on_CIFAR-10
Implementing 5 Machine Learning methods to CIFAR-10 dataset and comparing the results.

## 1. Introduction
CIFAR-10 classification problem is an image classification problem where we are required to 
build models to classify the correct images into correct categories. For example, when input a 
bird image the model is expected to put it in the class named as “Bird”, which is one of the 10 
different classes in CIFAR-10 dataset. There are 60000 32x32 colour images in these 10 classes, 
with 6000 images per class
